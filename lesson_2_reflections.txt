1.- What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When a repostory is initialized a .git directory is created, in which all 
metadata about tracked files is stored. This sets what is needed to start using
git as a VCS in our project. I need to initialize the repository in order to
implement version control with git.

2.- How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is in between the process of taking changes in our working 
directory to the repository. The staging area offers a way to flag the file or
files that we are considering to include in our next commit. It allows us to
choose every file that should be part of a particular commit, and split all
changes to different files in different logical commits.

3.- How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per
logical change?

I could add files to staging area and then use git diff to compare files at
staging area with the ones at the repository. (git diff --staged)

4.- What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your
history organized? How would branches help?

When there is the need to work on a major change in the project, that might
brake it and make it unusable for a while. In this case a new branch can be
created and leave the working master brach untouched.
