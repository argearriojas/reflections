What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When a repostory is initialized a .git directory is created, in which all 
metadata about tracked files is stored. This sets what is needed to start using
git as a VCS in our project. I need to initialize the repository in order to
implement version control with git.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is in between the process of taking changes in our working 
directory to the repository. The staging area offers a way to flag the file or
files that we are considering to include in our next commit. It allows us to
choose every file that should be part of a particular commit, and split all
changes to different files in different logical commits.
